Hi Prethiv here....

Here to help you setup the project in local and test.

To setup this project clone this github repo.

Go to PestoTodoApp via cmd.

cd serv

npm install

node index.js

Then open client folder followed by opening the index.html in any browser of your choice.

All of these choices of frontend and backend are solely only for this project,even though i am familiar with ReactJs,
Java8 & springboot and nodejs.

Level DB is choosen for the sake of simplicity and setting up this project locally easily.
